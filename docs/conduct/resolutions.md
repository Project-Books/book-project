# Code of conduct resolutions

This document details what and how possible code of conduct violations will be handled. 
As with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), this may 
be updated, so please ensure you stay up-to-date with any changes.

### Level 1: no further action

This is if we have concluded that there was no violation. 

Alternatively, we could come to this decision if the person who violated the code of conduct has genuinely and voluntarily
(i.e. without the project owner asking them to) apologised and pledged not to commit the violation again. In this case,
the project owner will confirm that they have witnessed the violation and that no further action is required as the 
offender has already apologised. This option is at the discretion of the project owner.

### Level 2: a public reprimand

A public reprimand may be issued in response to a public violation. In the event of a violation, a public reprimand 
will usually be the first point of call. Think of this as a warning.

If the individual becomes hostile after a public reprimand, a temporary or permanent ban will be put in place.

### Level 3: a temporary ban

A temporary ban from the repository. This can be thought of giving the person some time to "cool off".

An individual will be banned if they either:

a) become hostile after receiving a public reprimand, or

b) when a lower level response has already been made in the past, but the individual has reoffended.

### Level 4: a permanent ban

If an offender has, after first being temporarily banned, come back and committed yet another violation, they could
be permanently banned from the repository. 

This is at the discretion of the project owner, as it is dependent on factors such as whether it was thought to be 
intentional and whether the offender issued a genuine apology.

## Complaints about bans

Complaints about bans should not be made on the repository, but instead sent to bookproject@madebykarankumar.com where
it will be promptly reviewed by the project owner.
