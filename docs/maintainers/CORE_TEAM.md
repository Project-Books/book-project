# Core Team

Everyone who commits to the Book Project is considered a part of our team. The core team refers to those who beyond committing to the project and have added responsibilities to help maintain and push the project forward. 

All those in the core are held to the highest standard of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
In particular, all maintainers must be welcoming and inclusive to all at all times. If they are not, their role as a maintainer could be revoked. 

## Project owner

Karan ([@knjk04](https://github.com/knjk04)) first started this project and is the owner of the repository. As the project owner, this role also includes the maintainer role. Karan is active in committing to the project, reviewing code and helping others on the project over
Slack.

Karan has the final say on decisions and is in responsible for the overall direction of the project. However, Karan is always open to new ideas and thoughts. If you think
something could be done better, speak up! While we cannot guarantee that we will take your suggestion forward, we can promise that your feedback is valuable and that you
will be responded to, regardless of whether we take up your suggestion. If we don't take your suggestion forward, we'll also let you know why.

Should you have any concerns about any of the maintainers, Karan is the person to speak to. You can message him privately on Slack.

## Maintainers

### Current maintainers

In addition to Karan, there is

Amit ([@amit1307](https://github.com/amit1307))

 *Specialities: Java, micro services, Docker*

### Why we have maintainers

Maintainers have made regular and several significant contributions to the project over an extended period. Usually, the contributions are code, but it does not have to be. 
Maintainers could have made important contributions in, for example, design or documentation. 

A maintainer may have a particular area of expertise. You can then reach out to them should you need any help. We encourage the 
communication to happen over our public Slack [#book-project channel](https://teambookproject.slack.com/archives/C01AGDC5X1S) rather than privately so that others can also benefit from the responses. It can also help to settle disputes if we can all see the exchange(s). 

While everyone can help shape the direction of the project, this is particularly true of maintainers, as the owner and other maintainers may lean on each other.

As a regular committer, they can be given access rights to commit to the project. However, they are trusted not to do so unless until their work has first been reviewed. This also includes changes to the wiki.

### Responsibilities

A maintainer is expected to make regular, meaningful commits to the project. 'Regular' is intentionally vague as we appreciate that different people have different levels
of free time that they can spend on the project outside of the rest of their busy lives. Therefore, this is something that should be agreed upon with the owner. For 
example, if can only contribute once a month, that may be fine. The important thing is that the frequency of work is agreed upon.

When a build breaks or when we have high-priority bugs to fix, we depend on the owner and maintainers to help create fix or create a patch for them quickly.

In addition to regularly committing, a maintainer is expected to review pull requests regularly. As before, the definition of 'regular' should be agreed with the owner.
In general, we try to review pull requests within seven days (regular days, not working days) of having received them. If this is not feasible for you, please discuss
this with the owner as we are somewhat flexible on this.

Lastly, we have an active Slack workspace (formerly a Gitter community) where we can provide help to committers. We expect maintainers to be active here to help others. We don't expect
our maintainers always to be online, but to be responsive to messages directed towards them and undirected messages that they can help with. As a rule of thumb, we would
expect maintainers to reply within seven days.

Holidays and other commitments come up from time to time. This is fine, just keep us informed where possible.

We appreciate this is a large commitment to make, so we highly value the time and effort of all of our maintainers to help push the project forward.

### Becoming a maintainer

If Karan believes you are already operating at our maintainer standard, he may contact you to ask whether you would like to become a maintainer. If this is the case, we we still follow our process of agreeing on the details on how frequently you are available to help.

If you were not approached and would like to become a maintainer, feel free to message Karan ([@knjk04](https://github.com/knjk04)) on Slack. This can be done either privately or on the Slack [#book-project](https://teambookproject.slack.com/archives/C01AGDC5X1S) channel. If we say no, we will
be constructive by telling you what you would need to do to get there (e.g. contribute for longer to gain further trust). Please do not feel disheartened
if we say no. Think of it as 'not yet' rather than 'never'. If you ask Karan publicly on Slack, the assumption is that you are happy for a public response.

You will be asked to answer a [set of questions](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/blob/master/docs/maintainers/becoming-a-maintainer-template.md) (informal process).

### Revoking maintainer privileges

If a maintainer becomes unresponsive for an extended period, or if they violate our code of conduct or responsibility, they can have their role revoked.
While this may seem daunting, this should not come as a surprise as the owner should have already discussed this with you.
