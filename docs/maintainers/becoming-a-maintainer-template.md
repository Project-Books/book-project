# Becoming a maintainer template

If you have been offered the position of becoming a maintainer, then the following questions need to be answered to help set the expectations between the prospective maintainer and the a) owner and b) the wider team.

As explained in the [core team document](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/blob/master/docs/maintainers/CORE_TEAM.md), we appreciate people are flexible
and that becoming a maintainer is a big commitment. We want to be flexible to respect people's other commitments. If your 
availability changes, that's fine. The important thing is to let us know so that we are clear and can be respectful of your time.

1. At the very minimum, how frequently are you able to contribute (e.g. once a week, once a month, etc.)?

2. What is the main area that you will be able to help with (e.g. Hibernate & JPA, Docker, etc  .)?

3. At the minimum, how often are you able to help with reviewing pull requests (we aim to review all pull requests within at most seven days)?

4. Are you able to help fix failing builds or when we have high-priority bugs to fix regularly? If so, how often (e.g. weekly, fortnightly)?

5. Are you able to help others and respond to others on our Slack workspace (we aim to respond to messages within at most seven days)?
