At around 45 pages, it felt like all you're really paying for is the illustrations. ""Once upon a time in the North"" was an actual story, albeit short. <br/><br/>I think Pullman would have done better to write a collection of short stories under this title and publish it, or to lengthen this story to make it more interesting. It just felt like an account of someone's day stretched to reach 45 odd pages. <br/><br/>Perhaps the fault is mine for not doing my research before purchasing this. I don't like reading blurbs or descriptions for fiction books because I find them to give too much away. Having said that, I also think it's naughty that they (the publisher or Pullman -- whoever's to blame) included the first chapter of ""Once upon a time in the north"" to pad out the book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's small, but it does a lot to blend the book in the grey between reality and fiction. <br/><br/>I prefer the Cormoron Strike books to the other Sherlock Holmes books I've read because we're actually presented with all of the suspects before the real wrongdoer is revealed (I think I ranted about the suspect being someone who we weren't introduced to in one of my Sherlock Holmes reviews). It gets you, the reader, thinking of who the suspect could be. And that's really hard.

Absolutely brilliant. Einstein's life and pursuits are interesting, and I strongly feel that Isaacson did Einstein justice through this book despite being targeted at both scientists and non-scientists. There was, I feel, enough description of the details of Einstein's work, and fairly well explained by Isaacson.<br/><br/>Also, I think Isaacson is a talented biography author (I hope he didn't employ a ghostwriter now that I put that out there). Reading this after having read the Steve Jobs biography a few years ago, I had high expectations. And I didn't come away disappointed. As with the Steve Jobs biography, and as you would expect from an author of biographies, Isaacson cleverly balanced the quirks and idiosyncrasies of Einstein alongside the views of Einstein's contemporaries and that of Isaacson's. Isaacson's own views clearly showed that he admired the great maverick, whilst also being fair on what Einstein may have been lacking in personal matters. I particularly enjoyed Isaacson's own formulations on why Einstein was heralded as a genius whilst other great minds of the age, such as Godel, went by mostly unnoticed by circles outside of academia and the intelligentsia.<br/><br/>If you're interested in finding more about Einstein, I'd definitely recommend this book. There was hardly a moment when it wasn't interesting, and I finished the book surprised that there weren't more pages on Einstein even after Einstein's mortal life came to a close (in the copy I read, there were over a hundred pages dedicated to just sources).

Domingos's style came off as peculiar at times. An example: <blockquote>""Hahahaha""</blockquote> Why? He made a joke. Why not leave it there? It felt like he was trying too much to try to be funny, that, even when he was mildly amusing, he ruined it. Perhaps I'm harsh. <br/><br/>He's the expert, I'm not. Nonetheless, I still strongly disagree with his myopic beliefs on general intelligence not being feasible, and so not being a threat. For instance, he said, <blockquote>""The chances that an AI equipped with the Master Algorithm will take over the world are zero.""</blockquote> Is the probability of anything really zero? Would Hume concur that something can be impossible (the sun not rising tomorrow), particularly when we have limited knowledge to go on? It just seems to me like he thinks he has all it figured it out - the economics behind it and the way society will react. Would the public really embrace a future with little work and a living salary? I very much like that he gave suggestions on how a new society couldn't work (rather than just mention it offhandedly but casually tread over providing any details), but it felt less like a suggestion and more like a pronouncement from a time travelled from the future (arrogant). He did leave some open questions and give some, what I think to be as, good reasoning for some of his beliefs. More of this would have made the book, in my view, more balanced and fair. <br/><br/>His views and humour were only small annoyances. I don't think they got in the way of the purpose of the book. I just wish that he could simplify more of his explanations. He did use analogies to help the reader grasp the general concept sometimes, but I would have liked to have been able to understand more of the technical parts (and it felt like there were a lot in the middle of the book). I'm to blame for not being able to understand something, but I would have liked Domingos to make his technical sections more enjoyable, and less like reading a textbook.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>- The examples I chose were fairly isolated. They're from the last ten pages of the final chapter. I just chose the ones that irked me the most, and they happened to be at the end. Yet, I feel as if his authoritative tone was kept throughout.<br/>- I acknowledge that the author himself acknowledged his ""fanciful"" (his words, not mine) explanations. I would still have preferred him to not to be flamboyant. <br/>- It was still an interesting read, despite the negative tone of this review.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The ending played out how I thought it would, but that made things all the more exciting. Brown's use of constant dialogue and short chapters helps keeps the reader hooked on the details and the story, whilst still having descriptions of things like the environment, surroundings and non verbal interaction between characters to prop up subtle cues. This is by far the best book I've read all year, my favourite Dan Brown book and it thoroughly earns a place on my favourite books of all time shelf.  Chapter one hundred and four, particularly its climatic ending, was my favourite part of the book (UK edition). Although I'm grateful for the clarifications to the story in chapter one hundred and five, a part of me wishes it ended with one hundred and four. <br/><br/>I liked the mention of Elon Musk (I have a lot of respect for him) and dictionary.com (my favourite online dictionary). Although, I think it would have been more fitting for Kirsch to have a model S, not X, since the S is more of a sports car. Just a minor annoyance. I think that Brown went for the X because it is newer, not quicker or better. <br/><br/>I don't think Brown was not very accurate (or perhaps 'realistic' is a better choice) on the details of computer science and stereotypes for computer scientists. For one, I feel as if Kirsch should have adorned the classic hoodie and jeans look, instead of smart attire. Second, I think a computer scientist would have included spaces as a character, as you would in programming, so this should have been accounted for (not to mention the full stop, too!). I admire Brown's use of the words ""synthetic intelligence"" because I also feel that ""artificial intelligence"" is inappropriately named so. However, Brown does alternate between the terms he uses, without explaining it to the reader. I think a brief description, perhaps in the form of dialogue, explaining that ""synthetic intelligence"" and ""artificial intelligence"" refer to the same thing, may have made things clearer for the reader. I felt this strongly in chapter 105, when I first noticed ""AI"" being used as another alternative (I'd imagine readers may figure out that it's an abbreviation for ""Artificial Intelligence"", but some may not).<br/><br/>Trivialities aside, this makes a great read, particularly if you read the other Langdon books, and yet even more so if you're a computer scientist in the field of artificial intelligence, or at least know enough to be able to admire the story. <br/><br/>Note: I was close to the ending when I first wrote the review, but I hadn't actually finished it. Still, I was blown away by the book so much that I couldn't resist both rating the book and leaving a review. :)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It felt more like a full detective story than a small tale, for there was more characterisation here than in the two aforementioned novels. <br/><br/>It was a lot nicer that the reader could hazard a guess (or multiple) at who the criminal was, rather than, as was the case in ""A Study in Scarlet"" and ""The Sign of Four"", have the criminal be someone who was not explicitly mentioned up until the point of the revelation. <br/><br/>In further comparison to ""The Sign of Four"", although ""A Study in Scarlet"" is, to a lesser degree, also guilty of this, ""The Sign of Four"" had Watson fawn far too much, in my view, on Holmes. Perhaps this view stems from the latest BBC Sherlock series, where Watson, despite respecting the great deductive talents of Holmes, keeps most of hid admiration to himself. A more reserved military man who occasionally gets annoyed at Holmes more would, I feel, be more believable than the portrayal of Watson in ""A Sign of Four"". Contrastingly, I think it felt more warranted in ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" for reasons I'll leave the reader to figure out for themselves. <br/><br/>The only problem I have against this book is the somewhat anticlimactic finish. I'd imagine that many would not agree with me, but I felt that the novel had a crescendo with its series of events that should have finished with a more mysterious and shocking end. Doyle has the habit of making Sherlock reveal the criminal too early on, I feel, particularly in this crime case, where things may not have been so clear. It would have been far more gripping to see Holmes chase the wrong person only to find that the true criminal enjoyed having a free reign, with Holmes finally catching on and only just managing to apprehend the true criminal. Or something of the sort.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

It shared some fascinating insights into the early struggle at the company and some highlights on their journey to becoming a behemoth. <br/><br/>Joy Covey's email message was particularly moving, and one of my favourite parts of the book, as I felt it offered a good summary of the points into the book captured from, what seems to me, a candid and sincere viewpoint of a former executive. <br/><br/>The writing style could have been better, I think. Shorter chapters that encapsulate what the chapter heading is about could have made it clearer. The book gravitated away from Bezos after some of the early chapters and more to Amazon. That's fine, as the book is on both, but I feel it contradicts Stone's desire to detail Bezos like Isaacson captured Jobs. So, I think whilst there should be a strong focus on Amazon, it should be more of Bezos's achievements. Or, I'll just need to wait for the official Bezos biography.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In all fairness, this did produce a nice build-up to the end, it's just something that you have to be patient with. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW: <br/><br/>Another good thing is that I do think the language and imagery used was clever. One of my favourite things about this book is the idea itself and how it is portrayed as being rather scary. Things like the names of the different departments under the tyranny (e.g. Ministry of Truth) was fantastic. It would seem obvious to anyone who had read the book, but I still admire the choice of names. I just wished there was some signs of a possible revolt from the Proletarians, or even something to show why they wouldn't revolt. Something to add some excitement to the end. <br/><br/>The excitement picked up towards the middle and near the end of the book. I felt as if the middle and end was rushed. Although I had high expectations for this book, I felt as if the ending was somewhat of an anti-climax. The ending wasn't totally surprising. I figured some of it out from the middle when the excitement was boiling. It died away quickly when the grand plan of brotherhood fell apart. It fell too quickly. O'Brien was too understanding and I'm not a supporter of villains just explaining the corruption that was prevalent (like we see in movies a lot). Winston finding out about this himself, or with aides like Julia, would have been far more interesting, in my view.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It felt strange how sometimes they were  accompanied with a simple explanation, and at other times there was no simple explanation whatsoever. I think the book wouldn't be as gripping without the science parts, but I think Weir could have added some simple more simple explanations to help the layman and laylady alike understand it better. <br/><br/>The humour was enjoyable, even if at times lame. I probably didn't understand some of the early TV references, but there were plenty of other witty humour remarks. The humour was my favourite element of the book.<br/><br/>I think there wasn't much in the way of character development. Lots of them felt quite bland. I get that the focus is on Watney, but I still feel that more could be done, particularly with the Ares 3 crew. I think then Watney could have monologued more on his relations with each fellow team member. They sacrificed a lot to go back for him, but it seemed more like they duty than camaraderie. People like Venkat, who we hear a lot from, seem quite bland. I think supporting characters like him could have distinguished themselves more by the language used and the things said. Easier said than done, I guess. <br/><br/>The plot was quite dull. After a few setbacks, I came to the prediction that Watney would just survive anything on Mars and get home safely. No deaths and not many major problems that were unfixable (the food launch was the only one, I think).<br/><br/>It would have been more compelling had there  been even more struggle. It might sound horrible, but a death or an injury would have made more of an interesting read. Or, if Ares 3 came back to reduce Watney, but were stranded as NASA had pulled funding. I find it difficult to come to terms with NASA, in real life, paying billions to save someone's life with the risk level as high as it was.<br/><br/>Watney did face adversaries. Plenty, you may say. I might be unreasonable. I just reckon it was a bit too simple how most things were resolved, and some of it a little too quickly for my liking.<br/><br/>Towards the middle, it seemed less likely, and even the likelihood decreased as the book progressed, that Watney would have to wait for Ares 4 after all. That was disappointing because it seemed for a while as if an Ares 3 rescue wasn't a viable option.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
