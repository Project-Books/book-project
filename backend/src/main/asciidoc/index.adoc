= Book Project Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== Log in

=== Log in with test user account
.request
include::{snippets}/login/http-request.adoc[]
.response
include::{snippets}/login/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.

== Register

=== Register with a weak password
.request
include::{snippets}/register-with-weak-password/http-request.adoc[]
.response
include::{snippets}/register-with-weak-password/http-response.adoc[]
