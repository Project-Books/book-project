## What will the Book Project be?

We are building a hub for readers, authors and publishers. Fundamentally, we want to improve book discovery. It should be easy to find new books to read that match our users' interests. 
As a hub, we want our web app to be the single place that our users go to find the next great book and also to engage with authors, publishers and other readers.

## What we won't be

We're not another Goodreads or LibraryThing. We're rethinking what it means to be a book hub from the ground up and to provide a service that our users love. In other words, we're not 
producing a clone of an existing app. We're working on designing the best experience for anyone who loves books.
