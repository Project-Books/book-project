Book tracker web app made using Spring Boot and Vaadin 14 (only the free components will be used).

*Features:*
- Add books that you have read to a 'to read', 'currently reading', 'read' or 'did not finish' shelf
- View books in your different shelves and make changes
- A rating scale from 0-10 that that goes up in steps of 0.5
- Track your progress towards a reading goal: the number of books or pages you hope to read by the end of the year

*Coming soon:*
- Add your own shelves
- User registration and accounts
- And much more!

*The images above may look slightly different to the app. If major changes are made, new images will be uploaded to 
reflect this.*

## Setup

Prerequisites:
- JDK 11 (or higher) 
- If you don't have Node.js installed globally, it is not needed as Vaadin will install it automatically
  - If you do have Node.js installed, please ensure it is at least version 10.0
- MySQL 8.0.* or (better) Docker


1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project as a maven project into your favourite IDE (or run maven on the terminal)
3. Start the MySQL Database or run the docker-compose file `docker-compose up`
4. Run `BookProjectApplication.java`
5. Go to `localhost:8080`
6. Log in with the details below:
    - Username: `user`
    - Password: `password`
    
You may find lots of errors for things like the log statements, or the entities not having constructors. Below, you can find instructions on how to fix this for IntelliJ and Eclipse.

### IntelliJ
    
  <p align="center">
	<img src="/media/intellij_annotation_processing.png" alt="Enable IntelliJ annotation processing"/>
  </p>
    
To remove the errors in IntelliJ, install the [Lombok plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok) and enable annotation 
processing. This can be done either in the popup window that appears after installing the Lombok plugin or by checking the
'Enable annotation processing' checkbox in Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors.

### Eclipse

In Eclipse, you will need to run Maven install before running the project (right click anywhere in the pom.xml and select Run as > Maven install).

### Access database

To access the MySQL database when docker-compose is running:

1. Go to `http://localhost:8081/`
2. Log in with the settings below.
    - User Name: `root`
    - Password: `rootpassword`
3. Click on connect
