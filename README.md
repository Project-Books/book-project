Book tracker web app made with Spring Boot and React (Typescript).

*The image above is from our mockup designs, so this may look slightly different to the app. If major changes are made, we will upload a new image.*

# Getting started locally

Prerequisites:
- JDK 11
- Docker
  - Windows or macOS: install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Linux: install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

First, clone the repository (you'll need to fork first and then clone your fork if you're contributing). 

Next, start Docker engine (Linux) or Docker desktop (macOS or Windows). If you're using an Apple silicon chip, you'll need to uncomment [this line](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/blob/0.2.0/backend/docker-compose.yml#L6). 
 
## Running the frontend

1. Navigate to the [frontend/](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/tree/main/frontend) directory in a terminal
1. Run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the frontend container
1. Open `localhost:3000` once the development server has started

### Run Books API (optional)

You may want to also want to run our [Books API](https://github.com/Project-Books/books-api) to avoid seeing an error on the search page.

## Running the database

1. Navigate to the [backend/book-app](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/tree/main/backend/book-app) directory in a terminal
1. Start the PostgreSQL database using `docker-compose up -d db`
   - May need to add sudo to this command

### Access database (optional)

Using your favourite SQL client, use the following settings:
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5433`
- User: `dbuser`
- Password: `dbpassword`
- Database name: `book_project_db`

For example, in DataGrip or IntelliJ Ultimate:

## Running the backend

**Note:** The backend depends on the database, so please ensure you have started our PostgreSQL database with the instructions in the [section above](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project#running-the-database).

You can either run [BookProjectApplication.java](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/blob/main/backend/book-app/src/main/java/com/karankumar/bookproject/BookProjectApplication.java#L39) from your IDE (import as a Maven project) or run the steps below in a terminal:

1. Build the project in the `backend/` directory using `./mvnw clean install` (Unix) or `mvnw.cmd clean install` (Windows)
1. Start the application using `java -jar book-app/target/book-app-0.2.0.jar` 

## Log in with our test user

When running the frontend and backend, or only the backend, you can use the following test user:
- Email address: `user@user.user`
- Password: `password`

If you're running the backend, you will need a JWT token for subsequent requests after logging in or creating an account; see our [connecting to the backend](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/wiki/Connecting-to-the-backend-via-Postman) wiki page.

# Contributing

If you wish to contribute (thanks!), please first see the [contributing document](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

We work hard to make our project approachable to everyone -- from those new to open-source looking to make their first contribution to seasoned developers.

## Backend: fixing Lombok errors

You may find lots of errors for things like the log statements, or the entities not having constructors. 
You can find instructions on fixing this for IntelliJ and Eclipse in our [troubleshooting wiki page](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/wiki/Troubleshooting). 
Other common errors and solutions are also on the troubleshooting page.

## Help

If you need help with anything, we'll be happy to help you over a [GitHub Q&A discussion](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/discussions/categories/q-a). Alternatively, feel free to chat with us on the [#book-project](https://teambookproject.slack.com/archives/C01AGDC5X1S) channel on our [Slack workspace](https://teambookproject.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-punc8os7-Iz9PTCAkYcO_0S~XwtO5_A#/shared-invite/email).

When asking for help on Slack, we always recommend asking on our [#book-project](https://teambookproject.slack.com/archives/C01AGDC5X1S) channel, rather than contacting a maintainer directly. This is so that others can offer help and the answer may help someone else.

If you are able and willing to support us financially, it will go a long way to help us achieve our goals and become more sustainable. We hate to ask for money, but running cloud server costs are not free.

We currently only accept donations through Open Collective.
