Book tracker web app made using Spring Boot and Vaadin 14 (only the free components will be used).

*Features:*
- Add books that you have read to a 'to read', 'currently reading', 'read' or 'did not finish' shelf
- View books in your different shelves and make changes
- A rating scale from 0-10 that that goes up in steps of 0.5
- Track your progress towards a reading goal: the number of books or pages you hope to read by the end of the year
- Statistics about your reading habits
- Add your own shelves
- Export your saved data to JSON
- User registration and accounts
- And much more!

*Coming soon:*
- Search from a catalogue of books
- 2-factor authentication
- Magic links
- And much more!

*The images above may look slightly different to the app. If major changes are made, new images will be uploaded to 
reflect this.*

## Setup

Prerequisites:
- JDK 11 (the app currently won't work on later versions due to an issue with one of the libraries -- Karibu testing -- not being compatible with later versions) 
- If you don't have Node.js installed globally, it is not needed as Vaadin will install it automatically
  - If you do have Node.js installed, please ensure it is at least version 10.0
- MySQL 8.0.* or (better) Docker
  - Windows or macOS: install Docker Desktop
  - Linux: install Docker Engine and Docker Compose
 
### Running the app

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project as a maven project into your favourite IDE (or run maven on the terminal)
  
Then, if you want to use Docker, follow one of the approaches below:

#### 1. Start locally with only MySQL running in docker

3. Build the project at the root using `./mvn clean install` (Unix) or `mvnw.cmd clean install` (Windows)
4. Start the MySQL database using `docker-compose up -d mysql phpmyadmin`
5. Start the application using `java -jar target/book-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` 
6. Log in with the details below:
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `password`

#### 2. Start using docker-compose in production mode

3. At the root of the project, build the project in production mode using one of the following commands. In production mode all UI components are packaged in a jar file.
    - `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Unix), or 
    - `mvnw.cmd clean package -Pproduction` (Windows)
4. Start the MySQL Database and book project app using docker compose `docker-compose up --build`
5. Go to `localhost:8080`
6. Log in with the details below:
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `password`
    
#### 3. Start locally with Vaadin live reload (the tests do not run)

We recommended this approach if you need to work on the frontend with Vaadin. This approach allows you to use 
Vaadin Live reload which prevents you from needing to re-run the server every time or manually refresh your browser 
(i.e. it's a lot quicker). 

3. Start the MySQL database using `docker-compose up -d mysql phpmyadmin`
4. Run the project from your IDE or with Maven:
   - `./mvnw spring-boot:run` on Unix
   - `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` on Windows
5. Log in with the details below:
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `password`
   
If you're running the app from your IDE, after making a Vaadin-related change, build the app from your IDE after making
any changes.

#### Fixing Lombok errors

You may find lots of errors for things like the log statements, or the entities not having constructors. 
You can find instructions on how to fix this for IntelliJ and Eclipse in our [troubleshooting wiki page](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/wiki/Troubleshooting). 
Other common errors and solutions are also in the troubleshooting page.

### Access database

To access the MySQL database when docker-compose is running:

1. Go to `http://localhost:8081/`
2. Log in with the settings below.
    - User Name: `root`
    - Password: `rootpassword`
3. Click on connect
